    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Matter contained inside a nuclear reactor undergoes irradiation that causes successive cascades of nuclear reactions, modifying its atomic composition. Knowledge of this time evolving composition is an important parameter used to model the behavior of a nuclear reactor. But it is also a crucial input for __safety__ studies associated with its operation and is a key input __for the mitigation of severe accident__. It indeed constitutes, for instance the source term of the release of radioactive isotopes in the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modelling of the change in the atomic composition of irradiated materials over time is usually achieved using time expensive Monte Carlo simulations of the system being studied. Although precise, this calculation scheme has been found inadapted in crisis (i.e. accidental) situations, where faster calculation schemes have to be developped. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims at constructing a surrogate model capable at predicting the time changing nuclear inventory of a typical reactor of the French fleet. "

    "\n",
    "The atomic composition of the material subjected to irradiation usually involves thousands of isotopes. However, most of them have short lifetimes (characteristic decay time) and are not of critical interest for the safety of the facility or the mitigation of a reactor accident. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we propose to track the temporal evolution of __26 isotopes__ that have a significant impact on the reactor behaviour or are isotopes whose compositions are a key input for the study of the mitigation of an accident (they might be isotopes that are usually found to be released in the environment in accidental scenarios, or are important for safety reasons in general). \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-proliferation reasons, the isotopes were renamed and each of them are identified by a unique letter of the alphabet (e.g. the first isotope whose composition we would like to track is named \"A\").   \n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll be interested in the evolution of the content in isotopes \"A\", \"B\", ..., \"Z\" inside a reactor with time. The isotope content at each time is expressed in some kind of density unity ( ~ number of atoms per cubic cm).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling the irradiation in a nuclear reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the irradiation conditions of the nuclear materials, we suppose a simplified scheme for the temporal evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matter is put inside the reactor for a grand total of __1825 days__ (i.e. 5 years). \n",
    "\n",
    "This total period is subdivided into 5 different irradiation __cycles__ where each cycle correspond to a 300 days period with a certain configuration of the reactor (its operating power), charaterized by a single parameter *pi* (with i running from 1 -> 5).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Between 2 cycles, a period of 65 days was added and correspond to say, a maintenance period for the reactor, where the fuel is not irradiated (which note, doesn't mean the isotopes don't evolve). During these intercycle periods, we don't track the evolution of the isotopes content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the nuclear fuel is put inside of a reactor for a total of 1825 days with the following history :\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fuel is irradiated for 300 days (from T = 0 to T = 300) with parameter *p1*\n",
    "* The fuel is put to rest for 65 days\n",
    "* The fuel is irradiated for 300 days (from T = 365 to T = 665) with parameter *p2*\n",
    "* The fuel is put to rest for 65 days\n",
    "* The fuel is irradiated for 300 days (from T = 730 to T = 1030) with parameter *p3*\n",
    "* The fuel is put to rest for 65 days\n",
    "* The fuel is irradiated for 300 days (from T = 1095 to T = 1395) with parameter *p4*\n",
    "* The fuel is put to rest for 65 days\n",
    "* The fuel is irradiated for 300 days (from T = 1460 to T = 1760) with parameter *p5*\n",
    "* The fuel is put to rest for 65 days\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the exercise, the composition of each isotope will be tracked on a __20 days__ time interval basis, except for the periods where the fuel is put to rest, where the interval is 65 days (again, the evolution of fuel composition is not being tracked, but this doesn't mean it doesn't evolve...) . \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the end, for a given set of input data (which consist of the inital composition of isotopes A -> H and the 5 parameters p1,...,p5), the result is a time series of length 81 (initial composition + 80 timesteps).\n",
